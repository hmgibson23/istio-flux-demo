# Flux and Istio Sample Repo

This is a simple demo of managing Istio with Flux. It is forked from
https://github.com/stefanprodan/gitops-istio with a few added changes.

## Installation

The simplest way to get started with it is to run the `minikube.sh` script, which will run a
minikube cluster with Flux and Istio. You will need minikube installed for it to work.
